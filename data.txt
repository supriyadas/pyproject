This  time around, the leak is about the slo-mo recording feature that the phone is expected to come with. According to a tweet by Samsung_News_, the upcoming flagship smartphone may offer slow motion recording that lasts twice as long as the Galaxy S9 smartphones. As per the tweet, the phone will offer slo-mo recording at 960fps for 0.4 seconds as compared to the 0.2 seconds offered by Samsung’s current flagship smartphones.\n\nThis increase in slo-mo recording times will most probably be due to improved hardware. However, the resolution of the videos might still be capped at 720p, similar to what you get with the Galaxy S9 smartphones. \n\nLeaks and rumours have already given us a fair idea of what to expect from the smartphone. According to reports, the phone will feature a dual-rear camera setup, just like its predecessor. This time around, the phone is tipped to feature two 12MP sensors at the back, and both will feature Optical image Stabilisation or OIS. At the front, the device is expected to offer an 8MP camera. \n\nThe Galaxy Note 9 is expected to feature a design similar to its predecessor, but with one major change. At the back, the fingerprint sensor will most likely be moved to the bottom of the camera module instead of the side. The big change is supposed to come with the S-Pen stylus. the new stylus is said to offer Bluetooth connectivity.\n\nThe device is expected to feature a 6.3-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display and is tipped to be powered by either a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 or a Exynos 9810 chipset depending on the region. The phone may offer as much as 512GB of storage and may be priced at $1,460 in Europe. The Samsung Galaxy NOte 9 is also said to be the first Android phone to offer the popular game, Fortnite Battle Royale. The phone is expected to be unveiled on August 9.<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/digit/latest-from-digit/~4/wM4vE3rbQ8E\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>", "summary_detail": {"type": "text/html", "language": null, "base": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/digit/latest-from-digit", "value": "<img  src='https://static.digit.in/default/b4ec10256175187bf39389683c5147c684a5e9e8.jpeg' align=\"left\" hspace=\"2\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\"/> \n             Another day, another Samsung Galaxy Note 9 leak.
